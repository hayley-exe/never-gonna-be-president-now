                        Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28, 1856, in Staunton, Virginia, to Joseph Ruggles Wilson
                        and Jessie Janet Woodrow. His father was a founder of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate
                        States of America. Wilson earned a Ph.D. in history and political science from Johns Hopkins
                        University and later graduated from Princeton University before attending the University of
                        Virginia School of Law. Raised in the South, his religious upbringing and the impact of the
                        Civil War deeply influenced his views. A scholar, professor, and author, Wilson's teaching and
                        leadership experience shaped his future political career.

                    <p>
                        As a Democrat, Wilson campaigned on the platform of "New Freedom," opposing Theodore Roosevelt's
                        "New Nationalism." His focus was on labor reforms, anti-corruption measures, banking reform,
                        progressive taxation, tariff reform, and trust-busting through antitrust laws, positioning
                        himself as a champion for the common man and a staunch critic of monopolies and corporate power.
                        Wilson's commitment to these ideals resonated with many Americans, particularly those
                        dissatisfied with the status quo of concentrated corporate control. He won the 1912 election
                        despite strong competition, securing 42% of the popular vote and 435 electoral votes, aided in
                        part by the split in the Republican Party between Roosevelt and incumbent William Howard Taft.
                        This victory marked a significant shift in the nation's political landscape, as Wilson's
                        administration sought to challenge the growing power of corporations and push forward
                        progressive reforms that would shape much of the early 20th century.

                    <h1>Presidency</h1>
                    <p>
                        Wilson is remembered for his leadership during World War I and his advocacy for the League of
                        Nations, despite the Senate's failure to ratify U.S. membership. He implemented progressive
                        reforms like the Federal Reserve Act, reshaping the banking system. However, his presidency was
                        marred by numerous controversial policies. He supported racial segregation in federal agencies,
                        reversing progress on civil rights for African Americans, and his administration segregated the
                        federal workforce, a decision that had long-lasting, detrimental effects. Wilson's handling of
                        civil rights was often in stark contrast to his public persona as a progressive reformer, as he
                        showed little regard for African American rights. Furthermore, his initial reluctance to enter
                        World War I, despite the growing global tension, caused criticism from those who felt he
                        hesitated to act decisively. His suppression of dissent during the war, with actions like the
                        Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 that curtailed
                        freedom of speech and led to the imprisonment of many anti-war activists. His later years were
                        plagued by a severe stroke in 1919, which left him incapacitated and unable to effectively
                        govern, leading to a de facto loss of leadership. These factors contributed to his complicated
                        legacy, balancing major reforms with regressive social policies and controversial wartime
                        actions.

                    <p>
                        After leaving office, Wilson continued to advocate for the League of Nations, believing it could
                        prevent future conflicts. However, his passionate campaign for the League failed to sway the
                        U.S. Senate, and the nation never joined the international body, undermining his vision for
                        global peace. Despite this failure, Wilson remained adamant in his support, yet his credibility
                        took a hit due to his inability to secure the nationâ€™s participation. His post-presidency years
                        were largely marked by public frustration, as Wilson's health never fully recovered from the
                        stroke he suffered in 1919. His memoirs, though a personal recount of his time in office, were
                        often seen as self-serving and selective, glossing over his many failures and the damage caused
                        by his policies. Wilson's political legacy was forever tarnished by his steadfast defense of
                        racial segregation in federal agencies, his lack of meaningful action on civil rights, and his
                        disregard for the rights of African Americans during and after his presidency. Even as he
                        promoted peace and social progress, he left behind a legacy stained by his autocratic leadership
                        style and inability to reconcile his progressive rhetoric with his regressive policies. His
                        continued public appearances in his later years were increasingly disconnected from the harsh
                        realities of his earlier decisions, making him a figure of great contradiction. Wilson passed
                        away on February 3, 1924, due to complications from his stroke, marking the end of a presidency
                        filled with missed opportunities and a legacy defined by stark contradictions.
