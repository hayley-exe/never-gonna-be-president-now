                        Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28, 1856, in Staunton, Virginia, to Joseph Ruggles Wilson
                        and Jessie Janet Woodrow. His father was a founder of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate
                        States of America. Wilson earned a Ph.D. in history and political science from Johns Hopkins
                        University and later graduated from Princeton University before attending the University of
                        Virginia School of Law. Raised in the South, his religious upbringing and the impact of the
                        Civil War deeply influenced his views. A scholar, professor, and author, Wilson's teaching and
                        leadership experience shaped his future political career.

                    <p>
                        As a Democrat, Wilson campaigned on the platform of "New Freedom," opposing Theodore
                        Roosevelt's "New Nationalism." His focus was on labor reforms, anti-corruption measures,
                        banking reform, progressive taxation, tariff reform, and trust-busting through antitrust
                        laws. Wilson won the 1912 election despite strong competition, securing 42% of the popular vote
                        and 435 electoral votes.

                    <p>
                        Wilson is remembered for his leadership during World War I and his advocacy for the League of
                        Nations, despite the Senate's failure to ratify U.S. membership. He implemented progressive
                        reforms like the Federal Reserve Act, reshaping the banking system. However, his presidency was
                        marred by policies such as support for racial segregation in federal agencies, reversing
                        progress
                        on civil rights for African Americans. His health declined in his final years due to a stroke,
                        leaving him unable to govern effectively.

                    <p>
                        After leaving office, Wilson continued to advocate for the League of Nations, believing it
                        could prevent future conflicts. Although the U.S. did not join, he remained a vocal supporter.
                        He wrote memoirs and made occasional public appearances, advocating for peace and social
                        progress.
                        Wilson passed away on February 3, 1924, due to complications from the stroke he suffered in
                        1919,
                        marking the end of a controversial legacy.
