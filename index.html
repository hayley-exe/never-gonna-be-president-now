                        Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28, 1856, in Staunton, Virginia, to Joseph Ruggles Wilson
                        and Jessie Janet Woodrow. His father was a founder of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate
                        States of America. Wilson earned a Ph.D. in history and political science from Johns Hopkins
                        University and later graduated from Princeton University before attending the University of
                        Virginia School of Law. Raised in the South, his religious upbringing and the impact of the
                        Civil War deeply influenced his views. A scholar, professor, and author, Wilson's teaching and
                        leadership experience shaped his future political career.

                            As a Democrat, campaigned on the platform of "New Freedom," which opposed Theodore
                            Roosevelt's "New Nationalism." His focus was on labor reforms, anti-corruption measures,
                            banking reform, progressive taxation, tariff reform, and trust-busting through antitrust
                            laws. During the Progressive Era, the Republican Party split, and social reforms along with
                            the rise of labor movements gained traction. Wilson faced strong competition in the 1912
                            election from Republican incumbent William Howard Taft, Progressive Party candidate Theodore
                            Roosevelt, and Socialist Eugene V. Debs. Major issues included controlling corporate
                            monopolies, addressing income inequality, reforming the banking system, and advancing social
                            welfare. Wilson won with 435 electoral votes (out of 531) and approximately 42% of the
                            popular vote.
